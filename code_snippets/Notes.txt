Datasets for instruments:


URMP:
https://labsites.rochester.edu/air/projects/URMP.html
    contains audio recordings of 13 different instruments
    also has a lot of other data such as MIDI transcriptions and video

NSynth:
https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth
    has electronic, synthetic and acoustic musical instrument sounds
    audio is grouped into families of instruments, which could be a target for classification


Guitar, Drum, Violin, Piano:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumendraprasad/musical-instruments-sound-dataset
    - Guitar_Sound - 700 Sounds in Train Set
    - Drum_Souund - 700 Sounds in Train Set
    - Violin_Sound - 700 Sound in Train Set
    - Piano_Sound - 528 Sound in Train Set

Recommended resourses:

- Librosa is a python package useful for audio analysis: https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html
    I use this library most for fourier transforms, it's very common to train audio models ograms rather than time domain audio
    Check this out for some example usage

- Pandas is a python package for tabular data analysis: https://pandas.pydata.org/

- Matplotlib is a python package for graphing: https://matplotlib.org/

- Google Colab is useful for training models if your local machine isn't very powerful: https://colab.google/
    There are paid and free tiers, you can get GPU access even on free tiers
    If you haven't used code notebooks before, you can find more info at https://jupyter.org/. I love notebooks for playing around with and visualizing data.

For the musical instrument classification problem you're looking to tackle, there are tons of resources online

    - I found this article that treats audio spectrograms as images for sound classification: https://towardsdatascience.com/sound-classification-using-images-68d4770df426

    - Heres another article about classifying audio using convolutional networks: https://towardsdatascience.com/cnns-for-audio-classification-6244954665ab
